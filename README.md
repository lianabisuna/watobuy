## Learnings

In this app, I explored a new ~~framework~~ library! ðŸ¤£

React was new to me and I explored its features a bit. Everything was new to me, especially the syntax. I also learned about hooks which I don't practice in Vue.js. I was thinking if I should use Vanilla CSS but opted with Tailwind CSS.
